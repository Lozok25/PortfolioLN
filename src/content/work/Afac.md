Subject:
The AFAC 974 has called upon our services to develop a prototype of a virtual gallery featuring digitized reproductions of watercolors and drawings for the European Heritage Days 2023. The overall idea is to enable young visitors to explore works that promote Reunionese culture as if they were present at the actual exhibition, using digital tablets. PHP/Symfony will be utilized in the development process
